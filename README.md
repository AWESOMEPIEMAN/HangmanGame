# HangmanGame
This is a HangMan game I made using C++ in Visual Studio. To make the game work you also have to put the "words.txt" file in your "Open containing folder" so that the game has a list of random words to chose from. File handling was used for this purpose and the time.h library was used for random words picking. Hope ye enjoy :D
